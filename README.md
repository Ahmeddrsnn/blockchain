## Distributed Consensus (Raft)  ðŸ†•

> **Why?** Exchanges must stay consistent even if servers crash.  
> We embed a pureâ€‘Python **Raft** implementation that elects a leader, replicates
> trades, and reâ€‘elects instantly on failure.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Module  | `market_sim/blockchain/consensus` |
| Capabilities | Leader election <Â 300â€¯msÂ¹, log replication, crash/restart failâ€‘over, commit callbacks |
| Extras  | Timeline visualiser (`raft_timeline.py`) |
| Tests   | `market_sim/tests/unit/consensus/` (4 green tests) |

Run the consensus testâ€‘suite:

```bash
pytest market_sim/tests/unit/consensus/
```

Generate a leader/commit timeline after any simulation:

```python
from market_sim.analysis.visualization.raft_timeline import plot_timeline
plot_timeline(sim.raft)
```

<sub>Â¹ Simulated milliseconds in bundled unit tests.</sub>
